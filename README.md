The code here was used to test gene enrichments between sets of genomes.

The code was utilized to identify plant associated, non-plant associated,
root-associated and soil-associated genes.

## Requiremnts

The R code requires several R packages that are availabe online,
as well as the [AMOR](https://github.com/surh/AMOR) package.

Perl code was run with perl v5.8.8, but it should work on any recent
Perl5 version. The pipelines implemented in perl require a cluster
using LSF to work.
